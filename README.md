### Description

**URL: https://spark-daniel-smyth.vercel.app/**

My Web3 powered NFT minting application. Upload your artwork layers (e.g. Hat, Glasses, etc.) and Spark will multiply and mint up to 10,000 NFTs in seconds.

This application uses the (beta) `app/` directory introduced with Next.js 13. It allows you to nest layouts and colocate application code with your routes, like components, tests and styles.

### Installation

Install NPM packages.

```sh
npm install
```

Start in development mode http://localhost:3000.

```sh
npm run dev
```
